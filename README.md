# Brain Tumor Detection System
## Overview
The Brain Tumor Detection System is a machine learning-based project designed to detect brain tumors from MRI images. This system leverages convolutional neural networks (CNN) to analyze MRI scans and accurately identify the presence of tumors. The project aims to assist medical professionals in the early detection and diagnosis of brain tumors.

## Features
- Preprocessing of MRI images
- Training and validation of a CNN model
- Detection of brain tumors from new MRI images
- Visualization of prediction results
## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of MRI images of brain scans. The dataset can be obtained from Kaggle Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection.
